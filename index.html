          <p>note: <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#building-for-relative-paths">building for relative paths</a> - it says there, that if you put the whole homepage in the file or just a "." if you're not using client-side routing among other things... It's React &lt;Link&gt;, aren't they?</p>
          <p>I had to set the 'homepage' to 'https://bingis-khan.github.io/PIWbois/3/std-prjs/build/' for proper initial routing. *Sus*prisingly, navbar and routing works well. (navbar works, because it's not affected by routing) You just have to accept that none of the stuff inside react routing elements will be visible on initial load.</p>
